With the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, higher education institutions in India are adopting Four-Year Undergraduate Programmes (FYUP) and multidisciplinary course structures, offering students the freedom to choose Majors, Minors, Skill-Based, and Value-Added courses. However, this flexibility has made manual timetable creation extremely complex and time-consuming.
The AI-Based Timetable Generation System is an intelligent automation solution designed to tackle this challenge. It leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to dynamically generate conflict-free, optimized, and adaptive timetables that accommodate course preferences, faculty availability, classroom capacity, and credit distribution.
This system ensures efficiency, transparency, and flexibility in scheduling across departments while supporting multidisciplinary learning pathways envisioned by NEP 2020. By minimizing human effort and scheduling conflicts, it empowers institutions to focus more on academic quality and student experience rather than administrative complexities.
